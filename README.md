# weather-data-analysis
This project is a simple weather forecasting application built using Python. It fetches weather data from a weather API and displays the forecast for a given location. The application can be used to get current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant weather information.

### Features
•Fetch current weather data for a specified location.

•Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

•Supports multiple locations.

•Easy-to-use command-line interface.

•Can be extended to include historical data, predictions, and more.

### Prerequisites
In order to get the weather forecast information from external services,you'll need to sign up and obtain your own API Key:
